# drunken-ryu

Yeah, Ryu is drunk!! And now he wants to program in Go, because 
he can...

Ryu is a 3 years old dog. The last year he was in the street, now
he is Software Engineer Jr, and wants to write some code. He loves
code in new technologies and chicken (Actually he likes almost 
any food).

For now, Ryu is going to play with go, and hopefully this will
became a big project.

Ryu loves you... Ok, no he does not.
